# Minimum-Vertex-Cover

This is a project solving the minimum vertex cover problem. The Graph and FifoQueue ADT are slightly modified from the 
code provided by course TA, which is permited by the course.

This program can read a certain format of graph from txt. The first line should be vertex number, edge number and the rest lines should be the adjacent list. Please refer to the Graph folder.

This program solve the problem by greedy based approximation algorithm and an exact Branch and Bound algorithm. The quality
of greedy algorithm is pretty good while for small size graph the exact algorithm can reach the optimal in very quick.
